# Welcome to the Dungeons and Dragons Spell Finder

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This app allows you to look at individual spells from Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition via an official API. You can select a spell from a dropdown menu, and then read important information about it. It is a homework project from CodeClan which has become a longer running side-project. 

To run this app go to the root folder and in the terminal type:

npm start

This will then open the app at localhost:3000
